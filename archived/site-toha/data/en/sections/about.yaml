summary: |
  Lead Gameplay Engineer on **Huli: Nine Tails of Vengeance** — an action RPG built on
  Unreal Engine 5.7 targeting PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X. I architect and implement
  core combat systems, AI frameworks, and plugin infrastructure for a combat-driven
  gameplay experience.

  Previously shipped **6 mobile titles** (iOS/Android) as a Unity/C# developer,
  covering hyper-casual, puzzle, and simulation genres with App Store and Google Play releases.

  My technical focus areas include:
  - **Combat Architecture**: Custom GAS implementation with 7-stage damage pipeline, direction-aware parry, and visual combo editor
  - **AI Frameworks**: Hybrid State Tree + Behavior Tree system supporting 50+ concurrent entities at locked 60 FPS
  - **Plugin Infrastructure**: 19+ custom plugins following a strict three-tier dependency architecture
  - **Performance Engineering**: Console-grade optimization with async loading, AI LOD, and time-sliced coordination
